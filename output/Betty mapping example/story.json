    "story": "Name: Ayra Radakrishnan, Age: 25-years-old, Job: Healthcare Assistant. Ayra is a 25-year-old working as a healthcare assistant, a job which is largely spent at a desk. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes a day for 5 years. The skin changes occurred about nine months ago as dark patches under her armpits, with her noticing them after three months. Gradually these have thickened and darkened and she is bothered by their appearance. She has not been bothered by the patches in terms of discomfort or itchiness. Ayra books an appointment with the GP surgery. In the first appointment, the GP examines the patches and logs his findings in his GP notes. Because Ayra has no history of family skin conditions and she has had no former related illnesses, the GP suspects Ayra has acanthosis nigricans caused by insulin resistance of type 2 diabetes. In order to confirm this, the GP sends Ayra for an Hba1c test at the local hospital. Ten days later the test report arrives with the GP, who calls Ayra to inform her. The test result states that Ayra\u2019s blood glucose level is just over the threshold for diabetes; however, in order to confirm a diagnosis, the GP sends for another Hba1c test. Ayra goes to the local hospital again and has a blood sample taken. Another ten days pass and the second test report is sent to the GP. The result states Ayra\u2019s glucose levels are still in the diabetic range. Ayra receives a call from the GP receptionist, inviting her back to the GP surgery for an appointment in two weeks for a discussion about treatment and care planning. She is also given the results of her test. Ayra returns to the GP for her appointment. The GP formally diagnoses her with type 2 diabetes and updates the GP record accordingly. The GP explains the methods of self-management she will have to do, including administering metformin and recording this. Other factors like lifestyle change are also discussed, with the GP strongly recommending Ayra increases her movement and cuts down on smoking. This is all recorded in her care and support plan. After explaining these, the GP books Ayra for a blood glucose test in three months with a diabetes specialist nurse.",
